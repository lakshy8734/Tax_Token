🏛️ Tax Token - ERC20 Token for Tax and Transaction Handling
📝 Project Overview
The Tax Token is an ERC20 token designed for tax management in decentralized applications. This token handles tax collection, payments, and transactions within the dApp. It ensures secure tax reporting and management through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

💡 Features
ERC20 Standard: Full ERC20 compliance for easy integration.
Tax Collection: Collect taxes for transactions within the platform.
Automated Transactions: Automate tax deductions during transactions.
Reports: Generate tax reports directly from the smart contract.
🔧 Technologies Used
Solidity: Used for writing the smart contract for tax-related functions.
Truffle: Framework for smart contract development and testing.
Ganache: Ethereum simulator for testing.
Web3.js: Library to interact with Ethereum blockchain from the front end.
