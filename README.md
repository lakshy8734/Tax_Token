# 🏛️ **Tax Token** - ERC20 Token for Tax and Transaction Handling

## 📝 **Project Overview**
The **Tax Token** is an **ERC20 token** designed to automate and manage **tax payments** and **collection** in decentralized applications (**dApps**). It provides a seamless way for users to **pay taxes** and for platforms to manage the collection and distribution of taxes. By using **smart contracts**, the process becomes **secure**, **transparent**, and **efficient**.

## 💡 **Features**
- **ERC20 Compliance**: Ensures that the token adheres to the widely-used **ERC20 standard**, making it compatible with most **dApp** environments.
- **Tax Collection**: Automatically collects **taxes** during transactions, ensuring that **tax obligations** are met without manual intervention.
- **Automated Payments**: Facilitates **automated tax payments**, reducing the **administrative burden** and error risks.
- **Reports Generation**: Generates **tax reports** directly from the blockchain, making it easier for users and platform operators to track **payments** and **obligations**.
- **Decentralized Transactions**: The **smart contract** ensures that all transactions are **transparent**, **secure**, and **tamper-proof**.

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**
- **Solidity**: Used to write the **smart contract** that governs the **tax collection** and **payment** process.
- **Truffle**: Provides an easy-to-use framework for developing, testing, and deploying **Ethereum smart contracts**.
- **Ganache**: A **local blockchain** environment to test and deploy the **Tax Token** contract.
- **Web3.js**: A **JavaScript library** that enables interaction between the **smart contract** and the **front end** of **dApps**, allowing users to interact with the **Tax Token** easily.

## 🛠️ **How to Use**
- **Tax Token** is primarily used in applications that require **tax handling**, such as **decentralized marketplaces** or **transaction platforms**.
- The token facilitates **seamless tax collection** on every transaction made on the platform, while also generating **reports** and **automating tax payments**, reducing manual intervention.
